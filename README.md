**The AIC_BIC.R file is used to produce AIC and BIC scores for each model and dataset using mixed-effects modeling. The Discounting_NLMER_delayout file is used to perform LOOCV, holding out a delay at each iteration. 
The two files produce the scores resulting in the following figures:**

Note. AIC is left panel, BIC is middle panel, and cross-validation is right panel.


**The Discounting_NLMER_delayout_resids.R file produces residuals at each fold of cross-validation and results in the following figure:**
